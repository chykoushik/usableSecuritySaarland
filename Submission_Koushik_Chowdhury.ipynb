    "The goal of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with quantitative methods and statistics in practice. In the course of this assignment, you will parse and analyze logfiles of an online computer parts retailer. You will also learn to interpret these values to draw conclusions based on quantitative insights."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "You work for a regional online computer parts retailer Fresno, California and are responsible for the technical infrastructure. On January 12020 the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) has become effective and you just now realized that it requires a ”Do not sell” opt-out option for all customers.\n",
    "You want to go above and beyond this requirement by showing customers a 90 second long video that explains which data your company collects, how it is used, and under which circumstances you transmit them to third parties. However, when you asked the executive board what they thought about your plan they told you that (a) they would rather only implement the new law as minimally as required, and (b) you may only change the checkout-procedure if you can demonstrate that it does not affect the sales. Since the CEO attended a class in statistics in college, you will need to provide statistical tests to convince her.\n",
    "In order to eliminate the concern of the board you conduct a limited comparative test for one week with three conditions: (1) current checkout-procedure without any privacy related options, (2) ”Do not sell” opt-out possibility as required by CCPA, and (3) your 90 seconds video explanation with an opt-in at the end. You programmed the online shop software to randomly assign arriving customers to one of these three conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the three resulting Apache logfiles, and the inventory list from the Materials page on CMS. Your job is to find out if either of the two new options affects sales, i.e.\n",
    "the number of aborted checkout procedures, or the amount of money that shoppers spend on computer parts. You may solve this exercise either in R or Python. We expect your submission in a Jupyter Notebook that includes all necessary code and your written answers."

I discovered that, with the exception of the \"No Privacy\" log file, the other two are normally distributed. After that, I look at the homogeneity of variation between the two groups. For that, I used the Levene test. The variances are not significantly different from one another if the p-value for the Levene test is higher than 0.05, according to that, P value in my result is higher than 0.05 for Levene. If we examine the homogeneity between the three groups, even though the p value for \"No Privacy\" is less than 0.05 for the normality test, the p value increases, indicating that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. We can infer that any differences in purchase amounts between the three categories are probably not the result of different variances.  </p>\n",

One-way ANOVA is suitable test to determine whether there is a general impact on money spent across various log files as it is find significant differences of three or more groups. Additionally, while there are a few popular post hoc analyses for One way ANOVA, I chose Bonferroni because it employs t-test to perform pairwise comparisons between group means [1] as well as that is  something we learned in lecture. From One way ANOVA result, we can observed the p value is less than 0.05.

For instance, when using additional data, we attempt to determine which variable has a high correlation with the other. This number represents positive and negative correlation as -1 and 1, respectively. Apart from Correlation analysis, we can apply also regression analysis which is mentioned in one the lecture. It is also the same where we basically understand the relationship between one variable to another. Probably one of this 2 test can be help to find whether 'Video' is performing better than 2.
